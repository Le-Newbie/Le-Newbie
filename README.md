Hi there, I'm Joakeem or Le-Newbie! 👋 I'm on an exciting mission to become a Red Teamer 🛡️⚔️. This is my space to document every step of my journey, share my thoughts, and (hopefully) help others along the way.

🔥 My Interests :
  - Red Teaming 🕵️‍♂️: Breaking things to build stronger defenses.
  - Malware Analysis 💻🧪: Digging into the dark arts of malicious code.
  - Cloud Security ☁️🔐: Exploring the skies to find vulnerabilities.
  - IoT Hacking 📡🤖: Poking around in the connected world.
🎯 What You'll Find Here
  - HackTheBox Write-Ups 📜✨
  - I'll document normal and Sherlock boxes to share solutions and lessons learned.
  - Projects and Experiments 🛠️
  - From malware reverse-engineering to cloud penetration testing, it's all going here.
  - Insights and Reflections 🤔💬
  - Sharing thoughts, wins, and failures—because growth isn't always a straight line.
